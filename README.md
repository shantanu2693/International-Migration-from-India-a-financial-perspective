# International-Migration-from-India-a-financial-perspective

## Introduction:

Looking at emigration from India across various countries in the world, what do you think India's foreign policy should be, as far as maintaining relations with diaspora is concerned? What are the countries where we need to work on our diaspora engagement more, in order to bring more remittances home, given that there is scope? Should it be the country already sending the highest remittances already? 

Also, from a hypothetical perspective, what if these international migrants would have stayed back in India and never migrated in the first place, what would their financial contribution to the nation be vis-a-vis their remittances today. Will comparing these two notions provide a valuable insight?

This project aims to analyse these ideas gathering data sets from World Bank for the year 2021 w.r.t. India. 

**The primary assumption this project is based on is as follows - Imagine that migrants never left India and instead worked in India contributing to its GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Comparing this contribution (with Purchasing Power Parity adjusted) to the remittances sent by migrants will give us a value of 'Net Loss' w.r.t. every country. This parameter will be utilized to form our questions.**

## Data sources:

1. Bilateral Migration Matrix - https://www.knomad.org/data/migration/emigration
2. Bilateral Remittance Matrix - https://www.knomad.org/data/remittances
3. GDP per Capita (PPP adjusted) - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD

## Asking Questions:

Based on the datasets and the assumption of no migration case, where migrants never left the country and instead worked inside the country instead of sending remittances, we are interested to know the following:

1. Which 5 countries created the biggest net loss in terms of Remittances vs. Income earned in India (in zero migration case)
2. Which countries send the most remittances back home, while having highest net losses?
3. Which countries hold the most migrant stock, while having highest net losses?
4. Any common countries for which the answer to Question 2 and 3 is a yes? (That could possibly indicate which countries need our most attention for diaspora engagement and outreach activities)
